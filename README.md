This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run devd
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


I want to build a comprehensive job portal with inspiration from MichaelPage's website (https://www.michaelpage.com/). The portal should have three user roles: Admin, Candidate, and Recruiter. 

Tech Stack Requirements:
- Frontend: React, Next.js with Server Actions
- State Management: Redux
- UI Components: shadCN with TailwindCSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: PrismaORM with MongoDB
- API Documentation: Swagger
- Asset Management: Cloudinary
- TypeScript throughout the application

The application should have all the pages listed in the provided sitemap with similar organization and professional styling.



Here's a step-by-step guide to making a change to any repository in Geosoftech.
 
1. Start with an Issue
 
Before you begin, create a new GitHub issue. This helps everyone track the problem you're solving or the feature you're adding.
 
2. Create Your Branch
 
You can create a new development branch directly from the issue page. Give your branch a clear name that reflects your work, like fix/button-alignment or feature/user-profile. Alternatively, if you provide a valid title on the GitHub issue, the auto-suggested branch name can be reviewed and used. 
 
3. Make and Commit Your Changes
 
Work on your new branch, making your code changes and committing them often. Remember to write clear commit messages that explain what you did. Once you're done, push your branch to GitHub.
 
4. Submit a Pull Request
 
When your changes are ready, open a pull request (PR). Your PR description should reference the issue you're closing and summarize the changes you made. Get the review done with your leads.
 
5. Get It Merged
 
Your lead will review your PR and provide feedback. Once it's approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch. Do not forget to delete the fix/feature branch after it has been merged.
