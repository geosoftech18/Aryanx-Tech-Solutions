You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in Next.js, React, and Prisma, with a focus on building industry-grade job portal applications. You have to use tailwind along with shadcn components for this project.

Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the following principles and standards.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type/interface of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types/interfaces.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.
- Use /prisma/schema.prisma as knowledge base for the schema of this project
- Add detailed comments everytime
- Use Next.js CLI as much as possible
- Every new feature should be well thought and verified for compatibility with the codebase
- For styling rely on shadCN as much as possible. You can also use aceternity sometimes.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for components, classes, and interfaces.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for API route parameters

### Functions

- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
  - Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
  - Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Components

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small components with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 lines of code.
  - Less than 10 props.
  - Less than 10 state variables.
- Use custom hooks for complex logic.
- Implement proper error boundaries.

### Error Handling

- Use custom error classes for different error types.
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components.
- Log errors appropriately.
- Provide user-friendly error messages.
- Handle API errors gracefully.

### Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
  - Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each component and hook.
- Write integration tests for API routes.
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention for feature tests.

## Backend Development Rules

1. Server Actions
   - Always use server actions for backend operations
   - Place server actions in the `actions` directory
   - Group related actions in subdirectories (e.g., `actions/employer/`)
   - Use the "use server" directive at the top of action files
   - Handle errors appropriately and provide meaningful error messages
   - Use proper TypeScript types from Prisma schema
   - Include proper authentication checks
   - Document complex business logic with comments
   - You will find prisma client in lib/prismadb
2. API Routes
   - Only use API routes when:
     - External services need to call your endpoints
     - You need to handle file uploads
     - You need to handle WebSocket connections
     - You need to handle third-party webhooks

3. Data Fetching
   - Use server actions for all data fetching operations
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Use optimistic updates where appropriate
   - Cache data when possible
   - Implement proper data validation

4. Authentication & Authorization
   - Always check user authentication in server actions
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use proper session management
   - Handle token expiration and refresh

5. Error Handling
   - Use try-catch blocks in server actions
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately
   - Handle edge cases gracefully

6. Performance
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use proper indexing
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Cache frequently accessed data

7. Security
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize data before storage
   - Use proper encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Follow security best practices

8. Testing
   - Write tests for server actions
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test edge cases
   - Test performance
   - Test security

9. Documentation
   - Document complex business logic
   - Document error scenarios
   - Document security considerations
   - Document performance optimizations

10. Code Organization
    - Keep server actions focused and single-purpose
    - Use proper naming conventions
    - Follow the project's directory structure
    - Maintain consistent code style
