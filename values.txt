I want you to observe the whole structure of the jobs page, namely how I have created a job table, linked job name search, job delete using alert modal and ondelete function in actions@delete-job.ts job view using viewopen state and the job view modal@jobViewModal.tsx and then the edit and create job buttons in which are links that redirect to [jobId] page

 which checks the url for create or jobId and reused the job form for the same@page.tsx @page.tsx @job-form.tsx and how I have used Pick from the prisma schema type of job to define the job schema. and Implement similar structure for the application page.@applications  I want you to do the full implementation
